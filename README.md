# Taxi Fare Forecasting using BigQuery ML

This project is a lab exercise completed during the Machine Learning Engineer Learning Path course. It demonstrates a sequence of BigQuery ML queries to build and evaluate a linear regression model for predicting New York City taxi fares based on trip data.

The project utilizes the `bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_yellow_trips_2015` dataset, focusing on features like pickup and dropoff locations, time of day, and passenger count to predict the total fare amount (including tolls). Through model training, evaluation, and refinement techniques such as feature engineering, the project showcases the capabilities of BigQuery ML for real-world applications like fare estimation.
